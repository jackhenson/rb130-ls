# Custom Set

# Create a custom set type.

# Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom
# data structure of some type, like a set. In this
# exercise you will define your own set type. How
# it works internally doesn't matter, as long as it
# behaves like a set of unique elements that can be
# manipulated in several well defined ways.

# In some languages, including Ruby and JavaScript,
# there is a built-in Set type. For this problem,
# you're expected to implement your own custom set type.
# Once you've reached a solution, feel free to play
# around with using the built-in implementation of Set.

# For simplicity, you may assume that all elements of a
# set must be numbers.
